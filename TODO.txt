Critical Todo:

-Gk ignore - fix the plumbing
-Initialize hooks already present in repo  to each project (get hook repo [HOOKDIR - .hook assumed])
	-gk hook [HOOKDIR - .hook assumed]
-metastore merge in
-Submodule management
	- add code to git sync so that by default in checks for and freezes heads in all submodules to working tree state
	- add code to easily add,remove submodules.
		-gk create submodule
		-gk destroy submodule

Switch to dulwich for plumbing, and remove all exec methods from lib

Use gitlib as a wrapper around dulwich porcelain apis

Need more command line switches working.

gitkit.cfg
	->repos=[LIST OF FULL PATHS TO REPOS]

	gk setup repos
	->read file, ask user if they want to add or delete repos from gitkit. Run action accordingly
	(use dulwich to read each repo's config file)

For each repo:
	have a list of remotes, and a r/w attribute and priority attribute

	When gk setup repos is run, gitkit will crawl into each repo and list its remotes, asking what to do with each of them. By default, gitkit will sync all repos that it manages, but the git sync will accept a repo or repolist as an argument for repos to sync with their remotes

Have a way to dump config info to user (gk setup show / gk show setup?)

Wishlist:

-Verbosity levels
-syncing with u of m SVN mirrors (dcommit)
-remote fallbacks (option priority parm)
-netbeans wrapping
