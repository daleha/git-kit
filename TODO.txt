Basic pushing is working. Still need to write and connect some more plumbing, read from repos file, and configure it sync all branches.

Need more command line switches working.

Good start.

The script can at least push itself up to github

Seems to be doubling everything though... weird

Wishlist:

-syncing with u of m SVN mirrors (dcommit)
-remote fallbacks (prioritize)
-netbeans wrapping
-add hooks to each project (get hook repo)
-metastore merge in
